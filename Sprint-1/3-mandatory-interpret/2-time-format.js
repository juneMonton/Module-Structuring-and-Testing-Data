const movieLength = 8784; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

const result = `${totalHours}:${remainingMinutes}:${remainingSeconds}`;
console.log(result);

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

    /*
    There are 6 variable declarations
    const movieLength
    const remainingSeconds
    const totalMinutes
    const remainingMinutes
    const totalHours
    const result
    */

// b) How many function calls are there?-There's only 1 function call

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

    //The expression  movieLength%60 represents modulo operator, using %60 helps you extract how many seconds remaining.

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
    //totalMinutes represents how many complete minutes fit inside the movie length.

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?-the result variable formats the movie time to a string showing hours, minutes and seconds, it can be renamed to formattedTime

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer-Yes as long as the movieLength value is positive
