// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here: it has been called 3 times, hours, minutes and seconds

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here: 0 hours

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here: 00 0padded to 2digits

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here: 1 — the last call pads remainingSeconds, which is 1.

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here: "01" — 1 is converted to a string and padded to two digits.

//"00:01:01"
